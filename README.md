The purpose of this repository is to have my own implementations of neural networks from scratch. Simplicity takes precedence over efficiency here. I hope to appreciate the behind-the-scences work done by the popular libraries more by learning how it exactly happens.


## Neural networks from scratch.

There are 3 implementations right now, each one builds on top of the previous one:

1. [Logistic Regression](src/logistic_regression.py): simplest neural network with one node
2. [Shallow Neural Network](src/shallow_nn.py): modify logistic regression to include one hidden layer
3. [Deep Neural Network](src/deep_nn.py): generalise shallow neural network to add multiple hidden layers
